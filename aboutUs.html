THIS SITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!  About Us 
</h1>
<p>
This site was designed as a final project for an Accessible Website Developper course.  It is in no way affiliated with the Department for the Blind or the Virginia Center for the Blind and Vision Impaired.  
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this site is to give me practice in designing a website and to improve my ability to use HTML, CSS, and Java Script.  
</p>
<p>
The second purpose of this site is to give students interested in learning access technology the ability to follow a curriculum on line and interact with a website to improve their ability to learn access technology.  Both students at the Virginia Center for the Blind and around the world are welcome to interact with the website and use it for their benefit.
